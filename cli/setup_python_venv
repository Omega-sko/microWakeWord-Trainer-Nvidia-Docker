NOTICE: setup_python_venv is deprecated
================================================================================

This container uses system Python with TensorFlow pre-installed from the
NVIDIA NGC container. All required packages are available globally.

Virtual environment setup is no longer necessary or supported.

All training scripts (train_wake_word, wake_word_sample_generator, etc.)
now use the system Python directly.

If you see this message, you can safely ignore it. No action is required.
